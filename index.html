                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Cameron Chrobocinski and I am a junior
                    software engineer at USAA. I grew up in Corpus Christi,
                    Texas and graduated from Texas A&M University - Corpus
                    Christi with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I
                    currently live in Bryan, Texas. I am 25 years old. My wife,
                    Mary, and my daughters, Amelia and Briar, are my
                    inspiration. My corgi, Gidget, has kept me company since
                    2019. In my free time, I read and I play Dungeons & Dragons
                    or JRPGs. I attend rennaissance faires. I learn best through
                    examples and hands-on experience. If you'd like to chat,
                    please email me.
                </p>

                    Forked from another project that was written in CommonJS,
                    this version is rewritten from scratch in Next.JS, includes
                    more features, and gained some optimizations. It exists to
                    assist in planning and optimizing character builds in Elden
                    Ring. There are three main pages: a class selector, an armor
                    optimizer, and a weapon finder. The class selector finds the
                    optimal starting class for your build. The armor optimizer
                    displays the three best armor sets within your equip load
                    budget, and does so with an efficient knapsack algorithm.
                    The weapon finder displays every weapon that you can hold
                    and ranks them based on damage output. There are more plans
                    for this app in the future.

                    There was an expansion released for Dungeons & Dragons Fifth
                    Edition that added rules for running games set in the Dark
                    Souls universe. Unfortunately, the character sheet that was
                    published alongside it was subpar. I am working on an
                    interactive version of the character sheet that will make
                    playing the expansion much more convenient.

                    >: "Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method
                    for generating a near-random sample of parameter values from
                    a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is
                    often used to construct computer experiments or for Monte
                    Carlo integration." This project was written during a summer
                    internship that I did for TechSource, Inc., an LANL-adjacent
                    company in Los Alamos, New Mexico. I needed to better
                    understand Monte Carlo integration, and this helped to
                    facilitate that. I plan to bring this to a more accessible
                    format at some point.

                    This project was made as the final assignment for my Systems
                    Programming class during my Fall 2020 semester. It's a
                    program that accepts a binary message and simulates sending
                    the individual bytes over a network by sending the bites
                    across 3 unique processes, sending confirmation of receipt
                    messages, and printing the message once all bites have been
                    transmitted.
